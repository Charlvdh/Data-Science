# Data-Science

**Welcome to my Data Science repository!**

This repository contains some of my projects related to Data Science. These range from simple data cleaning and visualisation projects to reasonably in depth deep learning projects. 

**Note:**

Github has seemed to have some issues rendering **.ipynb** files lately so appologies if you get an error when trying to view these files. If you are unable to view the files on Github and have Jupyter Notebook installed then please feel free to dowload the notebooks and view them locally. If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine then you will be able to view the content in "Raw" mode but this will be far less illustrative of the actual content and purpose of the notebook.

Hopefully, however, this issue is sorted by the time you're looking at the files and you will not need to worry about this.
