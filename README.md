# Data-Science

**Welcome to my Data Science repository!**

This repository contains some of my projects related to Data Science. These range from simple data cleaning and visualisation projects to reasonably in depth deep learning projects. 

If my **Deloitte mill_board** application brought you here, welcome even more and in order to save you from looking through some of my less interesting projects please have a look at the following:
